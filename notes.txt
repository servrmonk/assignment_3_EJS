Model View Controller (MVC)
Structuring your code
What is MVC stand's for and what is it 
-> it's all about separation of concerns , making sure that different part of ur code do different things and u clearly know which part is responsible for what and MVC stands for Models Views Controllers and we already know what is views r in previous project 
Models r basically object or the part of our code that is responsible for representing ur data in ur code  and allowing u to work with our data (ex svaing data , fetching data etc)
views r responsible for what the users sees in the code simple html type
Controller r basically connections point between our models and views Controller r the "in-between" logic, split across middleware functions
Routes are basically for path for which http method which controler code should execute and controler is which views or model to render
